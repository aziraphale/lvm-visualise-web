     * Those scripts run the `pvs` and `lvs` commands (at least) and those
     *  commands always need to be run as root. The best way to give this script
     *  root access for those commands is to add a line or two in `/etc/sudoers`
     *  (via `sudo visudo`) permitting the webserver user account to run the .sh
     *  scripts in our ./bin directory without supplying a password to `sudo`
     *  (ideally the .sh scripts would then also be made read-only to the
     *  webserver user, so that a malicious web script couldn't modify "trusted
     *  scripts" to do nasty things).
     * The other options are:
     *  - permitting the webserver user to use sudo without a password to do
     *    /anything/, but then you have a giant security hole where any
     *    malicious or vulnerable script could take over the whole server very
     *    easily;
     *  - adding a password to the webserver user account and giving that
     *    password to this script, but then you risk remote agents connecting
     *    via SSH to the webserver's user - and then using sudo to take over the
     *    whole box (which is why this script DOES NOT SUPPORT being given a
     *    `sudo` password...);
     *  - or running the webserver as root, which has the same security issues
     *    as the first alternative option and is thus just as unwise
     * Seriously, just go with the first option - it's not that difficult!
     *
     * This option exists so that the script can continue to function even on a
     *  system where the webserver runs as root (thus `sudo` isn't required) and
     *  where `sudo` doesn't even exist, so attempting to run it would fail
     *  horribly.
